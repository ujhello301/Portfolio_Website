    "about": "Hi there! My name is Umang, and I am a skilled technologist and product manager. I have a proven track record of delivering innovative and successful products to market. My background in both technology and business allows me to bridge the gap between the two worlds and drive product development from concept to launch. As a PM I work with cross-functional teams to deliver results on time and on budget. I'm like the conductor of an orchestra, coordinating all the different pieces to create a symphony of awesomeness.\n \n I am a PM who loves to make an impact. I'm a self-thought product manager who is passionate about user experience and loves to create solutions for complex problems through user-centric design.\n \n When I'm not saving the day at work, you can find me indulging in my hobbies, like hiking, reading or playing video games, always looking for a new adventure to embark on. Let's make some magic together!",
